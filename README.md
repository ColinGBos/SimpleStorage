Please do! I am very much in favour of people helping me out, whether it be fixing
what mistakes I have made, new textures or even new features (may not pull everything).

Included in the repository is the style preference .xml preset I use, 
using this isn't completely necessary but I like the style.

Run gradle setupDecompWorkspace or gradle setupDevWorkspace in the root directory
Follow by running gradle eclipse - or idea 

Enjoy!
